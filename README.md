# letterToEveryone
Our goal is TO NEGOTIATE

The concept is a WEBSITE where people can find contact details of politicians of Russia and Ukraine and their representatives (chambers of governments, State Duma, the Verkhovna Rada, presidential office, "Единая Россия" and "Слуга народа" party). Also, representatives of various industries will be able to easily find contact details of exporting companies (IT, engineering, food industry, space industry, business, law, banks) that imposed restrictions against Russia (Belarus, Ukraine, CIS, EU) (the list is being updated). 

The project can become a tool in the development of world politics, the settlement of peace and the improvement of mutual understanding. The site will also include examples of emails, articles on how to write an email so that the PR department reads it. All emails will be sent anonymously from a private person's smtp server.

Each letter will be in an open database, everyone will be able to download it. Later, it will be possible to sign an open letter in order to attract attention to it (re-sending the person every n-signatures)
